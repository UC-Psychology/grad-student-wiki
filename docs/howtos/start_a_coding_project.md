# So, you're starting a new adventure???

Before you do anything else, make sure you're ready to use GitHub. The **first** step for that is making a GitHub account. If you haven't done that yet, go to [github.com](https://github.com) and follow the instructions to create an account.

1. Create GitHub Account
2. Have Trent (or another admin) add you to the UC-Psychology organization.
3. Create a new repository **on GitHub, within the [UC-Psychology](https://github.com/UC-Psychology/) organization**. 
    - Give it a good name, using all lowercase letters and separating words with hyphens.
    - Give it a quick description.
    - Initialize it with a readme.
    - Pick a relevant gitignore file (probably Python, or something recognizable)
4. Clone the repository to your local machine (I think using the GitHub URL is the easiest way to do this)
5. Open the repository in VS Code (or your favorite editor)
