## How to Use Git in the Command Line

To use Git in the command line, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Git repository is located using the `cd` command.
3. Initialize a new Git repository by running the command `git init`.
4. Add files to the staging area using the command `git add <file>`. You can also use `git add .` to add all files in the current directory.
5. Commit your changes by running the command `git commit -m "Commit message"`. Replace "Commit message" with a descriptive message about your changes.
6. To push your changes to a remote repository, use the command `git push <remote> <branch>`. Replace `<remote>` with the name of the remote repository and `<branch>` with the branch name.
7. To pull changes from a remote repository, use the command `git pull <remote> <branch>`. Replace `<remote>` with the name of the remote repository and `<branch>` with the branch name.

These are the basic commands to use Git in the command line. You can explore more advanced Git commands and features to enhance your workflow.

## How to Use Git in GitHub Desktop

To use Git in GitHub Desktop, follow these steps:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Click on the "Clone a repository" button.
3. Select the repository you want to clone and choose a local directory where you want to store the project files.
4. Click on the "Current branch" dropdown menu and select "New branch".
5. Give your branch a descriptive name that reflects the changes you plan to make, include your first name as the initial part of every branch you create, like this: `trent/add-mkdocs-tutorial-page`. In this example, Trent is adding a page to the wiki that will focus on a tutorial for using MkDocs. When you create a new branch, GitHub Desktop will automatically switch to that branch.
6. Make your changes to the project files.
7. Commit your changes by clicking on the "Commit to <branch>" button. Replace `<branch>` with the name of your branch.
8. Push your changes to a remote repository by clicking on the "Push origin" button.
9. To pull changes from a remote repository, click on the "Fetch origin" button.
10. To merge changes from a remote repository, click on the "Merge into <branch>" button. Replace `<branch>` with the name of your branch.
11. To create a pull request, click on the "Create pull request" button. This will open a new tab in your browser where you can review the changes and submit the pull request.
