These statements have not been vetted by faculty, however they are based on what has led to a successful MQE proposal.

### Note 1: A review is not a research proposal

The truth about a review is that it is a snapshot of a landscape, not an argument. It can be used as a launchpad for making arguments, but the idea is that you won't know what those arguments precisely are in advance. This can be confusing when people say you can use it as your dissertation introduction. There may be certain kinds of reviews that act as comparable dissertation intros, but a more theoretical review can be thought of in substantially different terms.

- [Types of Literature Review - A Guide for Researchers (wiki)](https://typeset.io/resources/types-of-literature-review/#what-is-a-literature-review)
- Here is a compare and contrast table to show some differences between a thesis paper and a review paper:

| Thesis Paper | Review Paper |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| You are writing background to create the rationale for doing certain research. | You are capturing a landscape (which can include several points that could be turned into rationales for future research). |
| You are expanding on a particular gap in detail. | Your snapshot of a landscape is from an angle which can help you identify several potential gaps that exist. |
| You are focusing in on a particular issue or problem. | Your topic is broad enough to contain many issues and problems which you can examine. |
| Your work will speak to a narrow, specific interest. | Your work will speak to a field, sub-field, or body of practitioners. |

### Note 2: Talk it out, over and over

- Because choosing an MQE topic can lack many clear guidelines or boundaries, it can be difficult to hone in on one topic. Make sure you are talking about your interests to multiple people over and over. Talking it through can help you refine your thinking and identify the things which you are truely passionate about.
    - A talking buddy can be a family member or friend, or anyone who will listen (a dog? a cat? a fish?). I've even "talked" to ChatGPT before.
    - While the MQE - *after your outline is approved by your committee* - is a "test" which you cannot receive feedback on as you complete it, there is nothing to bar you from talking about what you are learning and thinking with others.

### Note 3: AI can be your friend

- You can use [Elicit AI](https://elicit.com/) to identify research that exists, and even ask it to summarise concepts based on a selection of articles!
- You can also use [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/) as your "Talk it out" buddy, and ask if they know of any researchers who have looked at things similarly to the way you would like to.
- Students also have access to the organizational [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) through UC, which is like ChatGPT except it can search the live web via Bing.
    - If you login with your UC email, you can access a protected version which won't save any of your search data (it's reliability is questionnable, so always double check it's sources).

### Note 4: Ask peers to show you their outlines

  - The MQE is an independent "test" which begins once your outline is approved by your committee. While you are working on your outline, however, check with peers to see what they did for their outlines so you have an idea of the kinds of outlines that have been approved.
      - Everyone's MQE outline is very different, and every committee will have different reactions, so asking multiple people can be helpful.

## Section B: Steps for creating a stellar outline first draft

Below are some helpful steps to set you up for a strong initial MQE outline draft. As an interative process, you may circle back through steps as you review literature to refine your topic. In all cases, this is meant to set you up for the most constructive interaction with your advisor who will be there to offer feedback and suggestions for further refinement.

### 1. Identify Existing Papers to Emulate

After determining the type of paper you will be writing for your MQE (e.g., like an narrative review, or systematic review), visit a journal which publishes those kinds of papers and identify a couple examples of papers you would like to emulate. CORA faculty have recommended modelling after papers in the [Annual Reviews of Psychology](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/psych).

- You may also find model papers, or inspiring examples, as you are reviewing the literature to refine your topic idea. A good practice is to save the papers you really like as you find them, and then circle back to them when you are ready to choose one to model.
- Model papers do not need to be on your topic. They can simply be papers with a structure or approach that you want to emulate.

### 2. Reverse Outline Model Papers

Use the reverse outline method on the paper(s) that you have chosen as your model, or ideal format. Below are some quick reference guides for reverse outlining--keep in mind that the following guides are often referring to how to reverse outline your own work, but in this case you will instead apply the method to the model paper(s) you chose. This is how you can get a feel for how the papers were written, and the resulting outline will become a "paint by numbers" model for your own outline:

  1. [Harvard Kennedy School Communications Program](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/hks-communications-program/files/new_using_reverse_outlines_new_10_10_18.pdf): Using Reverse Outlines (brief)
  2. [UCLA Undergraduate Writing Center](https://uwc.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/UWC_handouts_reverseoutling.pdf): Reverse Outlining (brief)
  3. [University of Wisconsin-Madison Writing Center](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/reverseoutlines/): Reverse Outlines: A Writerâ€™s Technique for Examining Organization (handout)

### 3. Fill in the Outline with your Topic

Now that you have your "paint by numbers" version of your chosen model paper(s), all you need to do is replace details in the background, aims, and methods with the details that are relevant to your own MQE topic. You can leave the results and discussion sections empty, unless you want to outline the general structure or sections to be included there.

- Filling in the details will require you to be looking at the literature so that you can include either a reading list, or the citations you will be using when you start working on the MQE.

**This outline can be a very strong first draft of your MQE outline which your advisor can provide additional feedback on for refinement.**

## Section C: Tools for reviewing & writing

Below are tools I (EG) have found very handy for the MQE process, plus a few extras that may come in handy for others.

  1. **Reference Management Software:** [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) are both free reference management softwares. I use Zotero and lean on the tags and notes, and annotate articles. Zotero also has some handy plugins, but it is not for everyone. Below is a chart comparing the two:

| Feature | [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) | [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Storage Options** | 300MB free, expandable with any WebDAV server | 2GB free cloud storage |
| **File Management** | Organizes PDFs, PDF reader for annotations, Plugins available for deeper editing | Integrated PDF reader for annotations |
| **Citation Styles and Flexibility** | Supports many styles with easy customization | Supports many styles but with limited customization |
| **User Interface and Experience** | Utilitarian with flexible organization options | Sleek and user-friendly |
| **Literature Review** | Powerful tagging and searching capabilities, Browser extension for easy import from web, Import files or drag-and-drop from desktop | Import PDF files from desktop or web with single-click capture of research papers |
| **Notes** | Simple notes with tagging, Connect related items, Plugins available for deeper editing | Integrated PDF reader for annotations |
| **Tags** | Powerful tagging capabilities on both references and notes, Connect related items | Supports tagging but not as powerful as Zotero |

  2. [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/features?os=Windows): This is a powerful writing software that allows you to focus on writing one section at a time, or compile for editing altogether. This is handy when you are skipping around sections of a very long paper.
      - You can also use it for free for 30 non-consecutive days. After that there is a one-time educational fee of $50.99 for a perpetual license.
  3. [CADIMA](https://www.cadima.info/): This is a free web tool for systematic reviews (similar to [Covidence](https://www.covidence.org/)). It may be most useful for folks focused on more quantitative findings across papers.
      - Free!
  4. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): For those inclined to keep notes in Markdown, I LOVE this tool because I can keep all my notes in one place, across several vaults, and they are encrypted. 
      - I can also tag my notes and keep relevant ones linked together. They also have some really sweet community plugins to fancify your experience.
      - It's free, but if you want, you can pay the exorbitant $57.60/year fee (billed annually with an educational discount) to sync across all your devices.
  5. **Qualitative Analysis software**: Hottip!! If you have access to a good qualitative analysis software like **MAXQDA**, you can use it for literature reviews!
      - Just like analysing a transcript, you can analyse articles with highlighting, tagging, and referring to sections together in a way that makes synthesis of the articles much easier, particularly if you are doing more content analysis in your review.

## Section D: Using Copilot for Time Management

A quick way to manage your time and create a work schedule that works is to ask [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) (using your protected UC account) to create a schedule for you:
  
  | I need help with: | Ask [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/): |
  |-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
  | Creating a Timeline/Schedule | Let Copilot know anything about your schedule, constraints, or workload (such as needing frequent breaks, or not working on certain days), and it can generate a schedule for you in various formats (word, excel, markdown, etc). |
  | Schedules for Neurodiversity | You can say things like, "I have ADHD and have trouble with XYZ, and I need a schedule where I can review these articles in this time period", and Copilot will generate a schedule for you with built in breaks, etc. |
  | Assigning Articles for Review | You can upload article lists and ask it to create a schedule with assigned articles. It will also read comments in Word documents can assign those for review. |
  | Software Recommendations | You can also ask Copilot to recommend good software like Kanban boards, Pomodoro timers, and checklist organizers. You can specify if you want something free, or free for students. |
