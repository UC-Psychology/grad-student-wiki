# Contributing to the Wiki

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Create a GitHub account:** Visit the GitHub website [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a new account if you don't have one already. If you are a student at a University, you can sign up for a free student account with additional benefits, like GitHub Co-Pilot - a must have! To learn how to sign up for Co-Pilot, visit the tutorial on setting up co-pilot in the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products#github-co-pilot).

2. **Join the UC Psychology organization on GitHub:** If the MkDocs project you want to contribute to is part of the UC Psychology organization, request to join the organization by visiting their GitHub page and clicking on the "Join" button.

3. **Set up GitHub Desktop:** Download and install GitHub Desktop from the official [GitHub Desktop website](https://desktop.github.com). This tool will help you manage your Git repositories and make it easier to contribute to the project.

4. **Clone the project repository:** Once you have GitHub Desktop installed, open it and click on the "Clone a repository" button. Select the MkDocs project repository you want to contribute to and choose a local directory where you want to store the project files.

5. **Create your own branch:** In GitHub Desktop, click on the "Current branch" dropdown menu and select "New branch". Give your branch a descriptive name that reflects the changes you plan to make, include your first name as the initial part of every branch you create, like this: `trent/add-mkdocs-tutorial-page`. In this example, Trent is adding a page to the wiki that will focus on a tutorial for using MkDocs. When you create a new branch, GitHub Desktop will automatically switch to that branch.

Now you are ready to start contributing to the MkDocs project on GitHub using GitHub Desktop. Make sure to follow the project's guidelines and best practices for making changes, creating pull requests, and collaborating with other contributors.

Happy contributing!
