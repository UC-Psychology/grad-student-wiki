## Material for MkDocs

MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

Themes can be added to MkDocs documentation projects, the theme we are using is called "Material for MkDocs". To learn about the theme for our documentation, head over to the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) documentation site.
